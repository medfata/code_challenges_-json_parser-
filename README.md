# Custom JSON Parser

This project is a custom JSON parser implemented in Java, following a functional programming approach. The parser uses a two-phase process where the JSON input is first tokenized by a lexer and then parsed into a data structure by the parser.

## Project Structure

- **Lexer**: Converts JSON strings into a list of tokens.
- **Parser**: Processes the list of tokens to build the JSON data structure.
